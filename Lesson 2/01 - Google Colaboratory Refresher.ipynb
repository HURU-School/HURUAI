    "[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true), otherwise in short Colab, is a product developed by the Google research team. It runs in the cloud. It does not require any setup. The notebooks you create can be simultaneously edited by your team members. It also supports the major machine learning frameworks. Colab has attracted a wide following in the AI community due to its free **GPU (Graphical Processing Unit)** and **TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)** offering."
